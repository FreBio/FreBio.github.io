**Hopital Richard Toll Senegal** was an interest group founded in 2012 to provide support to a hospital and related research projects in northern Senegal. The hospital Etablissement Public de Santé de Richard Toll is centrally located in the north of Senegal along the national road and is therefore highly important for the public health in the area of Richard Toll. The hospital is also a crucial research center aiding various international research groups in studying and controlling parasitic diseases. The most debilitating disease in northern Senegal is the highly epidemic disease schistosomiasis, which causes cognitive and physical retardation of many children. 
Despite the importance for public health in this region, the hospital is facing heavy financial and material problems since May 2011. Medical doctors, nurses, researchers and field teams don’t have the proper material anymore to assure the quality of health care. 

What is urgently needed for the hospital?
➢ A four-wheel drive car that enables healthcare professionals to travel to remote villages who would otherwise never enjoy health care. To purchase a new car we need about 20.000 euro.
➢ Diverse medical equipment for the hospital, such as medicines, bandages, surgical instruments etc.

How will the money be fundraised?
On 7 octobner 2012 a total of eight people will run the marathon or half marathon (www.brusselsmarathon.be) to support this project. With their participation (and heavy training linked to it!!) they wish to place this charity in the spotlights in order to raise financial support from family, friends, acquaintances… 

How can you support us?
In the first place, we are seeking for as much financial funds as possible, and this of any kind or amount. Next to financial support, we also accept non-expired medicines that will be offered to the hospital during the next field research mission. See ‘link: Your support’ for more information.

Link: Runners
Here is a list of the runners that will participate in the Brussels Marathon & Half Marathon on 7 October 2012 to support this project. See www.brusselsmarathon.be for more information about the marathon and its route. Next to training three days a week during several months, individual runners will also advertise this project to family, friends and acquaintances to raise as much money as possible. To thank and meanwhile motivate their support, the organizers offer a free and professional one-hour massage to the runner that fundraised the most money. Obviously, the massage will be paid by the personal account of the organizer, and not by the account of the project.
