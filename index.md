Hi there, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine. I am mainly interested in eukaryotic parasites causing neglected diseases that plague the poorest in tropical regions. I am particularly interested in using population genomic data to understand the evolution, hybridization and adaptation of parasites such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma, and I also do some work on Schitsosoma.
