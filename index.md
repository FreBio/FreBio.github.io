I am a post-doctoral researcher specialized in **parasite genetics** at the [Department of Biomedical Sciences](http://www.itg.be/e/department-of-biomedical-sciences) in the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine. 

I am particularly interested in understanding how **pathogens** evolve in nature, addressing questions such as: how do parasites become drug-resistant? Which genes are involved? What is the role of parasite sex in spreading those genes? Answering these questions with **genetic and genomic data** could provide new hope in controlling or even eliminating diseases. While diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis merit considerable scientific attention, it is important not to overlook the **tropical diseases** that plague the worldâ€™s developing countries. My research focuses on the three such diseases that have devastating worldwide consequences for both human and animal health:
* **(Muco-)cutaneous leishmaniasis**. While the disease is not deadly, it leads to a disfiguration of the face and consequently social stigma.
* **Animal African Trypanosomiasis**. This disease is fatal in most untreated cases, resulting in annual losses of 3 million animals that increases impoverishment of sub-Saharan Africa.
* **Schistosomiasis**. This disease seriously reduce childhood survival rates.

## My main projects
Kinetoplast genomics to study evolution and hybridization of eukaryote pathogens
Speciation genomics of Leishmania Viannia
