I am a post-doctoral researcher specialized in **parasite genetics** at the [Department of Biomedical Sciences](http://www.itg.be/e/department-of-biomedical-sciences) in the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine. 

I am particularly interested in understanding how **pathogens** evolve in nature, addressing questions such as: how do parasites become drug-resistant? Which genes are involved? What is the role of parasite sex in spreading those genes? Answering these questions with **genomic data** could provide new hope in controlling or even eliminating diseases. 

While HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis merit considerable scientific attention, it is important not to overlook those **tropical diseases** that plague the worldâ€™s developing countries. My research focuses on three such diseases that have devastating worldwide consequences for both human and animal health:
* **(Muco-)cutaneous leishmaniasis** or ***espundia*** leads to a facial disfigurement and consequently social stigma in South-America.
* **Animal African Trypanosomiasis** or ***nagana*** kills about 3 million cattle every year in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to poverty and low food nutrition in this region.
* **Human Schistosomiasis** affects more than 200 million people worldwide, reducing childhood survival rates. 

## My main projects
Kinetoplast genomics of Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma congolense to study evolution and hybridization of eukaryote pathogens <br />
Speciation genomics of Leishmania Viannia
