During my PhD, I used genetic markers to retrospectively gain insight into the evolution and epidemiology of intestinal schistosomiasis in **Northern Senegal**. The construction of two **water barrages** in the Senegal River Basin in the 1980â€™s radically changed the environment resulting in one of the most severe **epidemics of schistosomiasis**. 

I designed **genetic markers** (chapter 2) to reconstruct the **history of** this **epidemic** (chapter 3) and explore the impact of **host-specific factors** (chapter 4) and **drug treatment** (chapters 5 and 6) on parasite genetics. Following genetic analyses of historical and contemporary samples, I showed that the epidemic was triggered by many different parasite strains that were probably introduced by seasonal workers from neighboring regions (these findings were cited in several Belgian newspapers such as *De Morgen* and *[De Standaard](http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20150814_01818987)*. In addition, we found that drug treatment had no effect on the genetics of parasites sampled from 12 children that were monitored for over two years. My PhD concluded that the *Schistosoma* populations in northern Senegal retained a large genetic repertoire, allowing the selection of epidemiological relevant traits such as drug resistance or virulence, and underlining the complexity of controlling schistosomiasis.
